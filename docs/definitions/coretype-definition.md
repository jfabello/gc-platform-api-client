# `Coretype` Definition

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| id | `string` | No | The globally unique identifier for the object. |
| name | `string` | No |  |
| version | `number` | No | A positive integer denoting the core type's version |
| dateCreated | `string` | No | The date the core type was created. Date time is represented as an ISO-8601 string. For example: yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss[.mmm]Z |
| schema | [`Schema`](schema-definition.md) | No | The core type's built-in schema |
| current | `boolean` | No | A boolean indicating if the core type's version is the current one in use by the system |
| validationFields | `string[]` | No | An array of strings naming the fields of the core type subject to validation.  Validation constraints are specified by a schema author using the core type. |
| validationLimits | [`ValidationLimits`](validationlimits-definition.md) | No | A structure denoting the system-imposed minimum and maximum string length (for text-based core types) or numeric values (for number-based) core types.  For example, the validationLimits for a text-based core type specify the min/max values for a minimum string length (minLength) constraint supplied by a schemaauthor on a text field.  Similarly, the maxLength's min/max specifies maximum string length constraint supplied by a schema author for the same field. |
| itemValidationFields | `string[]` | No | Specific to the "tag" core type, this is an array of strings naming the tag item fields of the core type subject to validation |
| itemValidationLimits | [`ItemValidationLimits`](itemvalidationlimits-definition.md) | No | A structure denoting the system-imposed minimum and maximum string length for string-array based core types such as "tag" and "enum".  Forexample, the validationLimits for a schema field using a tag core type specify the min/max values for a minimum string length (minLength) constraint supplied by a schema author on individual tags.  Similarly, the maxLength's min/max specifies maximum string length constraint supplied by a schema author for the same field's tags. |
| selfUri | `string` | No | The URI for this object |
