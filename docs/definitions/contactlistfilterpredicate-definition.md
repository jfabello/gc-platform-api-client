# `ContactListFilterPredicate` Definition

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| column | `string` | No | Contact list column from the ContactListFilter's contactList. |
| columnType | `string` | No | The type of data in the contact column. |
| operator | `string` | No | The operator for this ContactListFilterPredicate. |
| value | `string` | No | Value with which to compare the contact's data. This could be text, a number, or a relative time. A value for relative time should follow the format PxxDTyyHzzM, where xx, yy, and zz specify the days, hours and minutes. For example, a value of P01DT08H30M corresponds to 1 day, 8 hours, and 30 minutes from now. To specify a time in the past, include a negative sign before each numeric value. For example, a value of P-01DT-08H-30M corresponds to 1 day, 8 hours, and 30 minutes in the past. You can also do things like P01DT00H-30M, which would correspond to 23 hours and 30 minutes from now (1 day - 30 minutes). |
| range | [`ContactListFilterRange`](contactlistfilterrange-definition.md) | No | A range of values. Required for operators BETWEEN and IN. |
| inverted | `boolean` | No | Inverts the result of the predicate (i.e., if the predicate returns true, inverting it will return false). |
