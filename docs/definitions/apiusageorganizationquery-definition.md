# `ApiUsageOrganizationQuery` Definition

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| interval | `string` | Yes | Behaves like one clause in a SQL WHERE. Specifies the date and time range of data being queried. Intervals are represented as an ISO-8601 string. For example: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss/YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss |
| granularity | `string` | No | Date granularity of the results |
| metrics | `string[]` | No | Behaves like a SQL SELECT clause. Enables retrieving only named metrics. If omitted, all metrics that are available will be returned (like SELECT *). |
| groupBy | `string[]` | No | Behaves like a SQL GROUPBY. Allows for multiple levels of grouping as a list of dimensions. Partitions resulting aggregate computations into distinct named subgroups rather than across the entire result set as if it were one group. |
