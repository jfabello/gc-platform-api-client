# `AdjustableLiveSpeakerDetection` Definition

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| mode | `string` | No | Modes to tune between speed to live speaker detection vs accuracy. |
| preconnectDuration | `string` | No | ISO 8601 formatted relative duration (e.g., PT30.8427419S for 30.8 seconds), calculated on line connect. |
| eventName | `string` | No | The name of the event that triggered the ALSD evaluation (e.g., line.connect, speech.generic). |
| isPersonLikely | `boolean` | No | The output of the ALSD detector, evaluating whether there is likely a person on the call based on the above inputs, and if so, a person is detected early (person disposition name and speech.person analyzer result) and the associated action taken (e.g., speech.person postconnect entry in the disposition table has the action to transfer to a queue). |
| totalRingbacks | `number` | No | Number of tone.ring.* analyzer events detected during the call (expected mostly during pre-connect but the last ringback tone detection could potentially complete after line connect, which will increment totalRingbacks still). |
| lineConnected | `boolean` | No | Protocol line connect received (answered by a person, machine, busy, fax). |
