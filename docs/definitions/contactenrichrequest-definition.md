# `ContactEnrichRequest` Definition

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| id | `string` | No | A user-specified tracker string, only useful in the Bulk-Enrich API. If one Bulk-Enrich operation in a request fails, the requested operation will be repeated in the Bulk API response, including this id field, allowing associating of request and response operations. |
| division | [`WritableStarrableDivision`](writablestarrabledivision-definition.md) | No | The division to which this entity belongs. |
| matchingIdentifiers | [`ContactIdentifier[]`](contactidentifier-definition.md) | Yes | An ordered list of one or more Identifiers which might each be claimed by a Contact. `action` describes what to do with any possibly matching Contacts. Identifier lookups will occur in the order specified here. |
| action | `string` | Yes | The action that should be taken based on any Contacts found by `matchingIdentifiers`. |
| contact | [`ExternalContact`](externalcontact-definition.md) | No | Data to be added, either as an update to an existing Contact or the body of a new Contact. Omitting a field in this contract means that it will be treated as null in the `fieldRules` logic. |
| fieldRules | [`EnrichFieldRules`](enrichfieldrules-definition.md) | No | Logic describing how to combine data from the submitted request with data found in the database. |
| options | [`ContactEnrichOptions`](contactenrichoptions-definition.md) | No | Additional options modifying the behavior of the API operation. |
