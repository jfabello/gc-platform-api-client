# `ItemValidationLimits` Definition

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| minLength | [`MinLength`](minlength-definition.md) | Yes | A structure denoting the system-imposed minimum string length (for text-based core types) or numeric values (for number-based) core types.  For example, the validationLimits for a text-based core type specify the min/max values for a minimum string length (minLength) constraint supplied by a schemaauthor on a text field.  Similarly, the maxLength's min/max specifies maximum string length constraint supplied by a schema author for the same field. |
| maxLength | [`MaxLength`](maxlength-definition.md) | Yes | A structure denoting the system-imposed minimum and maximum string length (for text-based core types) or numeric values (for number-based) core types.  For example, the validationLimits for a text-based core type specify the min/max values for a minimum string length (minLength) constraint supplied by a schemaauthor on a text field.  Similarly, the maxLength's min/max specifies maximum string length constraint supplied by a schema author for the same field. |
