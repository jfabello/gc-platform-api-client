### `postAuthorizationRolesDefault`

Restores all default roles

#### Description

This endpoint serves several purposes. 1. It provides the org with default roles. This is important for default roles that will be added after go-live (they can retroactively add the new default-role). Note: When not using a query param of force=true, it only adds the default roles not configured for the org; it does not overwrite roles. 2. Using the query param force=true, you can restore all default roles. Note: This does not have an effect on custom roles.

#### Endpoint

`POST /api/v2/authorization/roles/default`

#### Parameters

- `query` - **(object)** The query string parameters for the request. An empty object or `null` is allowed if all query string parameters are optional.
