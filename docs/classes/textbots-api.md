#### Endpoint

`GET /api/v2/textbots/bots/search`

#### Parameters

- `query` - **(object)** The query string parameters for the request. An empty object or `null` is allowed if all query string parameters are optional.

- `query.botName` - **(string, optional)** Bot name
- `query.botId` - **(string[], optional)** Bot IDs
- `query.pageSize` - **(number, optional)** The maximum results to return

#### Returns

A promise that settles to an [`HTTPResponse`](https://github.com/jfabello/http-client) object with the response of the call to the API endpoint. The promise fulfills if the HTTP status code is between 200 and 299. The promise rejects for any other HTTP status code.
