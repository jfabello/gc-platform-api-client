### `getAnalyticsBotflowDivisionsReportingturns`

Get Reporting Turns (division aware).

#### Description

Returns the reporting turns for the specified flow, filtered by the clients divisions and grouped by session, in reverse chronological order from the date the session was created, with the reporting turns from the most recent session appearing at the start of the list. It is expected that the client will URL encode the request URI once only. For pagination, clients should keep sending requests using the value of 'nextUri' in the response, until it's no longer present, only then have all items have been returned. The 'nextUri' value in the response is already URL encoded (so it doesn't need to be encoded again). Note: resources returned by this endpoint are not persisted indefinitely, as they are deleted after approximately, but not before, 10 days.

#### Endpoint

`GET /api/v2/analytics/botflows/{botFlowId}/divisions/reportingturns`

#### Parameters

- `botFlowId` - **(string, required)** ID of the bot flow.
- `query` - **(object)** The query string parameters for the request. An empty object or `null` is allowed if all query string parameters are optional.
- `query.after` - **(string, optional)** The cursor that points to the ID of the last item in the list of entities that has been returned.
- `query.pageSize` - **(string, optional)** Max number of entities to return. Maximum of 250
- `query.interval` - **(string, optional)** Date range filter based on the date the individual resources were completed. UTC is the default if no TZ is supplied, however alternate timezones can be used e.g: '2022-11-22T09:11:11.111+08:00/2022-11-30T07:17:44.586-07'. . Intervals are represented as an ISO-8601 string. For example: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss/YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss
- `query.actionId` - **(string, optional)** Optional action ID to get the reporting turns associated to a particular flow action
- `query.sessionId` - **(string, optional)** Optional session ID to get the reporting turns for a particular session. Specifying a session ID alongside an action ID or a language or any ask action results is not allowed.
- `query.language` - **(string, optional)** Optional language code to get the reporting turns for a particular language
- `query.askActionResults` - **(string, optional)** Optional case-insensitive comma separated list of ask action results to filter the reporting turns.

#### Returns

A promise that settles to an [`HTTPResponse`](https://github.com/jfabello/http-client) object with the response of the call to the API endpoint. The promise fulfills if the HTTP status code is between 200 and 299. The promise rejects for any other HTTP status code.
