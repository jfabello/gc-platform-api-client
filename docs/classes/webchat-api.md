### `postWebchatGuestConversations`

Create an ACD chat conversation from an external customer.

> [!WARNING]
> This method is deprecated and may be removed in the future.

#### Description

This endpoint is deprecated. Please see the article https://help.genesys.cloud/articles/deprecation-removal-of-acd-web-chat-version-2/. This endpoint will create a new ACD Chat conversation under the specified Chat Deployment. The conversation will begin with a guest member in it (with a role=CUSTOMER) according to the customer information that is supplied. If the guest member is authenticated, the 'memberAuthToken' field should include his JWT as generated by the 'POST /api/v2/signeddata' resource; if the guest member is anonymous (and the Deployment permits it) this field can be omitted. The returned data includes the IDs of the conversation created, along with a newly-create JWT token that you can supply to all future endpoints as authentication to perform operations against that conversation. After successfully creating a conversation, you should connect a websocket to the event stream named in the 'eventStreamUri' field of the response; the conversation is not routed until the event stream is attached.

#### Endpoint

`POST /api/v2/webchat/guest/conversations`
